In Selenium, the CSS class selector is one of the fastest and most reliable ways to find elements. In CSS syntax, a class is always represented by a **dot (`.`)**.

## 1. The Basic Syntax

If your HTML looks like this:
`<input class="login-field">`

Your Selenium code will look like this:

```java
// Logic: find the element with the class "login-field"
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".login-field"));

```

---

## 2. Advanced Class Selectors

Sometimes a simple class isn't enough because multiple elements might share it. Here is how to be more specific:

### A. Tag + Class

If you only want an `input` that has that class (ignoring `div`s or `button`s with the same class):

```java
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input.login-field"));

```

### B. Multiple Classes (Chaining)

If an element has multiple classes like `<div class="btn primary active">`, you chain them together with dots and **no spaces**:

```java
// This looks for an element that has ALL three classes
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".btn.primary.active"));

```

### C. Parent-Child Navigation

If the input is inside a form and you want to navigate down:

```java
// Logic: find a form with class 'main-form', then any input inside it
driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".main-form input"));

```

## 3. Dealing with "Space-Separated" Classes

A common mistake is trying to use `By.className` with a string that contains spaces.

* **Incorrect:** `driver.findElement(By.className("btn primary"));` → **Throws Error.**
* **Correct:** `driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(".btn.primary"));` → **Works!**

## 4. Why use CSS over XPath?

| Feature | CSS Selector | XPath |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Faster (native to browsers) | Slightly slower |
| **Syntax** | Clean and short | Verbose and complex |
| **Compatibility** | Works in all browsers | Works in all browsers |
| **Limitation** | Cannot search by text | Can search by text |

## Summary Cheat Sheet

| Requirement | CSS Selector Syntax |
| --- | --- |
| Single Class | `.className` |
| Multiple Classes | `.class1.class2` |
| Tag and Class | `input.className` |
| Child Element | `.parentClass .childClass` |
| Direct Child | `.parentClass > .childClass` |
